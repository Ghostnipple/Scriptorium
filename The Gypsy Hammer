// The Gypsy hammer V.3 (Designed by ghostnipple, built by Professor Ruzli)
// It requires mydicebot to run. My own preference is for the console version of mydicebot (https://mydicebot.com/).
// This version updates the version number from 1 to 3, umm thats about it really.
// This script will lose you money, they all do eventually. It might make you rich, but thats unlikely. 
// Use for educational and entertainment purposes. 
// Modify the variables below to match your seed conditions.
// If you donâ€™t know what that means best not use the script babe.  
// But seriously, know when to quit, its the secret of successful gambling. 
// The odds favour the house and in the long run the house will win.
// Many thanks to Professor Ruzli for his time and his help in the production of this script.
